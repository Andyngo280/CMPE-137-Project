# blackjackv1

A BlackJack flutter project.

## Getting Started
To run the project on Android Studio without any out of bounds errors on the screen. Make sure the emulator screen size is at least 5.5 inches. But for the best user experience, 6 inches will be the perfect fit.
We recommend using the Pixel 5 for the perfect screen.

1. Download the project.
2. To install the dependencies, run the following command:
```
flutter pub get
```
If there is an error to install the package please try type
```
flutter pub add PackageName
example:
flutter pub add just_audio
flutter pub add flutter_switch
```
If there is an error when trying to run the program, run the following command:
```
flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
